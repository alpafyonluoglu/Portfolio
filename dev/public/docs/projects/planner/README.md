# Planner
Time management, made easy.

Planner is a time management tool that aims making it possible for you to use time effectively, balance your life, and do more in less time.
It automatically creates personalized flexible weekly plans that adapts you and changes as your behaviours change. Weekly plans are designed to divide your energy
equally to days of the week while being biased to spare more free time for weekends than weekdays.
The card-based home page brings up a card for anything that requires your attention, keeping everything in one place and preventing distraction of your focus.
UI & UX is designed to be used together with Google Calendar.

Here is how and why it works in a nutshell... The app reads the events that are already saved in your calendars, considers user-entered activity and rezerved blocks, 
and analyzes all these time blocks together. By considering busyness of your days and personalized parameters that are learnt with time, 
time patterns are created for all activities, which are then brought together to create a weekly plan.
Events of created plan are automatically saved to the calendar. Even after being done with creating a plan, Planner continues to watch these events;
so if you find changing time of an event more suitable and do so manually via a calendar app, Planner analyzes your changes to create slighly modified plans next time
that are more suitable for you.

## Features
- **Main feature:** Creates personalized weekly plans! Keeps your time planned, your energy distrubuted throughout the week, and your mind clear.
- **Activity blocks:** Add time blocks that will be added to your calendar by Planner. Include all details that are required for Planner to understand where to place
this block in your weekly plan. Block details include: time limit, session limit, day limit, preferred interval, need break before, need break after, 
tiring, add pomodoro timer, prioritized.
- **Reserved blocks:** Placeholder-like time blocks. Even though these blocks do not appear in a calendar, Planner does not place events in these blocks.
- **Suggestions:** Get suggestions about what to do now if you have spare time. 
Working on automatically managing your calendar to apply the suggested action...
- **Personalization:** Planner tracks changes that you make to calendar events to learn your preferenecs and create time plans that are more suitable for you.
- **Event tags:** Planner automatically recognizes and tags events according to their titles.
- **App shortcuts:** Link apps with event tags. When there is an ongoing event, related card in the home page will have wuick access links for those apps.
- **Pomodoro timer:** Event durations can be planned by considering extra pomodoro breaks. Working on integration of a pomodoro timer...
- **To-do lists:** Access event-related to-do list by flipping that event's card to quickly navigate to the to-do app. 
Working on integration of a built-in to-do list keeper...
- **UX:** Intuitive navigation with gestures, swiping, double tapping even out of buttons.
- **Intentional restrictions:** While Planner can access all calendars, it is restricted to modify only one unless otherwise is allowed by the user. This restriction
keeps manually added calendar events safe from unwanted modifications.
- **Privacy:** With introduction of an unusual way, Planner stores all your data in your calendar. No personal data is sent to the server side, 
which also allows synchronizing -and restoring- data without signing in.
- **Extra (app integration):** Events addded by Planner are recognized by Ada Assistant, allowing Ada to know what you are doing at any time and act accordingly while
communicating with your contacts when you miss a call.
