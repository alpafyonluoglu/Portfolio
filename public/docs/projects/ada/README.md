# Ada Assistant
An assistant that deals with your callers when you are busy.

Ada is a personal assistant app developed to handle the needs of your 
friends/contacts when they cannot reach you. It knows about the events in your
calendar, the plan of your current day, the places that you usually hang around, 
your current location, and the access level of contacts. In accordance with this 
information, Ada informs the other person about your situation or makes changes on the
device, such as adding a remainder or taking the device out of silent mode and ringing
it if there is an emergency situation. Ada automatically starts a conversation when a
call is missed or a contact mentions Ada by sending an SMS that starts with "@ada".

## Features
- **Main feature:** Ada communicates with your contacts when a call is missed or a contact mentions Ada in an SMS.
- **Context-aware conversations:** Ada remembers previous messages from that conversation and analyzes messages by considering
the context. For example, receiving an SMS saying "Yes" may lead to different actions depending on what the previous
messages were about.
- **Access levels:** Set trusted contacts having full control over Ada, or blacklist contacts to prevent them from accessing
to Ada. By default, Ada does not talk with anyone outside of Turkey or people who are not saved in your contacts.
- **Privacy:** While Ada considers your location and calendar events when communicating with your contacts, such data is 
only used to estimate when you will be available to reach back to the caller. No personal information is sent explicitly 
to your contacts, except your trusted contacts, who has the option to access your location if they request to learn where
exactly you are at. This is a feature allowing trusted contacts to locate the device when it is lost or find the device
owner when the owner is in a bad condition and needs help.
- **Calendar & location tags:** Let Ada know more about your place & time by tagging the places you usually hang around
and your calendars according to what the events of a calendar is about. 
- **Remainders:** When the caller needs to reach you and Ada cannot help them, Ada creates a remainder by attaching 1-2
of received messages that you can briefly read to understand the problem without having need to read the whole conversation.
- **Emergency alert:** In emergency situations, Ada takes your device out of silent mode and rings it in loud volume as
long as your calendar does not prevent it, like when you are in an exam. To prevent overuse of this feature, Ada asks for
your feedback when someone uses this feature and changes trust level of your contacts accordingly to restrict, or completely
block, access of your contacts to Ada's features permanently.
